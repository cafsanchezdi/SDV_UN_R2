# costmap_common_params.yaml

# The costmap_2d package provides a configurable structure that maintains 
# information about where the robot should navigate in the form of an occupancy 
# grid. The costmap uses sensor data and information from the static map to 
# store and update information about obstacles in the world through the 
# costmap_2d::Costmap2DROS object.
# More info in http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d
#
# This file contains global and local costmap common parameters.

# Obstacle layer
# The obstacle layer tracks the obstacles as read by the sensor data.
# More info in http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d/hydro/obstacles

# Inflation layer
# The inflation layer is an optimization that adds new values around lethal 
# obstacles (i.e. inflates the obstacles) in order to make the costmap represent
# the configuration space of the robot.
